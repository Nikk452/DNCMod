<hr>
<p>Dungeons and crafting is a Minecraft mod inspired by a popular game named Dungeons and Dragons. Just like the game, the mod sets the game in a medieval fantasy world, in which players get to choose their races, classes, skills, et cetera and embark on an adventure with the other players.</p>
<p>Of course the mod is going to allow you to level up, get hidden achievements, sub classes, kill unknown monsters and progress with your character&apos;s lore. However, currently the mod isn&apos;t finalized and has many more feature awaiting to be added.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Current Feature List:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Character Creation:</strong> When you enter a server or a world, a screen menu opens up and let you start your own character, the menu is divided to 5 pages, first page is to choose your custom name that gonna be shown above your head and instead of your in game name in the chat. Next 2 pages are about choosing your class and race, currently we have 6 classes and 3 races. 4th page lets your roll random stats for 6 stats, you can switch places between the rolled stats, so for example you can switch places with the roll you got in STR and the roll in DEX. Page 5 is about choosing skills that are appropriate to your class.</li>
    <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Currently the game has 27 skills(8 working ones) that are all available to you through character creation, the skills that are available for use are: Swim, Jump, Mine, Stealth, Acrobatics, Insight, Investigation, Perception</li>
    <li><strong>LVL UP!&nbsp;</strong>We replaced the normal leveling system and placed our own experience bar and level that indicate the character&apos;s total level, which is all classes levels combined. You are able to level up through killing certain mobs, however, currently only skeletons drop the custom experience that is used to level up your class, to level up the class you should press the key designed for it.</li>
    <li><strong>Ores and Resources:&nbsp;</strong>There are many resources and materials that were added to the game, of course currently they have no use but they are already able to generate in your world.</li>
    <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> We added very few weapons, they gonna have a use very soon since the next update is about combat system.</li>
</ul>
